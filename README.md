#  University of Manchester:Lab block A - TVHolography

Script made to analyse the affects of providing a potential difference across piezolectric material (seeing how it deforms) by using a TV Holographic technique.

For those more interested in the process of the lab and subsequent measurements, the lab notebook made during the experiment and lab report made afterwards is also attached.
